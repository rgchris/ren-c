**	NARROWED (AND NOTICEABLE) CASTING MACROS
**
**		C has a single casting operator `(type)value`.  The severity
**		and pitfalls in using carte-blanche casts are VERY numerous;
**		with many C (and C++) programmers unaware of the precise rules
**		and consequences of how it can result in undefined behavior
**		or breaking optimized builds.  For instance, "strict aliasing":
**
**			http://dbp-consulting.com/tutorials/StrictAliasing.html
**
**		Despite being able to go very wrong and requiring heavy scrutiny,
**		C's cast operator can be hard to see among all the other uses of
**		parentheses.  They're hard to scan for visually, and a mechanical
**		search is hard as well.
**
**		For this reason, C++ separated C's universal casting operator
**		down into a handful of distinct operators.  Which cast you use
**		depends on exactly what you were trying to accomplish:
**
**			http://stackoverflow.com/questions/332030/
**
**		These casts were given long names to make them stand out.
**		One reason that this was considered acceptable is that in C++,
**		the use of casts is discouraged.  They are rarely necessary if a
**		design isn't having to do anything involving interfacing
**		with C code.
**
**		These macros bring the benefits of granular casting to Rebol,
**		but without *requiring* it to be built with a C++ compiler.  The
**		shorthand of `CAST(type, value)` can be used for a basic cast;
**		already making it stand out from other parenthesizations.
**		Then these can be annotated with a prefix letter in lowercase
**		to give a not-too-visually-disruptive way of marking a cast type.
**		(It still most noticeably says "CAST" with no underscores or
**		other visual noise.)
**
**		It's not immediately necessary to convert all old-style casts
**		to a cast variant here.  When building with C++, then that is
**		when an alarm is raised to mark the cast's actual motivation.

**
**	MEMORY ALLOCATION AND FREEING MACROS
**
**		Although C provides malloc() and free(), Rebol historically
**		did not trust these as providing adequate performance.  It
**		elected to do memory pooling... so it would do some large
**		block mallocs and then subdivide from that:
**
**			https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_pool
**
**		Today's world has better allocators which can be substituted
**		for malloc() that do clever pooling under the hood.  `tcmalloc`
**		is popular:
**
**			http://jamesgolick.com/2013/5/19/how-tcmalloc-works.html
**
**		Important to note is that it would be naive to think that an
**		off-the-cuff implementation of a generalized memory pool
**		could perform better than well researched approaches, without
**		some very specific inside knowledge about the allocation
**		patterns:
**
**			http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/tcmalloc.html
**
**		However, Rebol has two pieces of inside knowledge to exploit.
**		One is that it isn't multi-threaded for most intents and
**		purposes.  Hence a non-thread-safe allocator can be some
**		noticeable bit faster.  (Whether one sees this as an argument
**		for "just use malloc" or "TASK! wasn't meant to be anytime soon"
**		is the reader's choice.)
**
**		The second piece of knowledge that can be exploited is that
**		REBSER and REBGOB items are allocated more frequently than
**		other sizes, and it's also necessary for the garbage collector
**		to be able to enumerate through the list of allocated items.
**		With a custom pool, the management of blocks and freelists
**		can be tied in with that.
**
**		Hence for the moment, malloc() and free() are abstracted as
**		Make_Mem() and Free_Mem().  Of particular note is that
**		Free_Mem() insists you know the size of the memory you are
**		freeing, as it wants to be able to limit allocations and
**		know when memory is reaching a certain threshold to run
**		a garbage collection.
**
**		These macros help use Make_Mem and Free_Mem more safely,
**		and are modeled after C++'s new/delete and new[]/delete[].
**		Zero-filling helpers are provided to ease concern regarding
**		the loss of the old macros:
**
**			#define CLEAR(m,s) 	memset((m), 0, (s));
**			#define CLEARS(m)	memset((m), 0, sizeof(*m))

**
**  "C CODE TYPES"
**
**		Rebol was first released in 1997, when the C language had nothing
**		in the way of guarantees regarding stable sizes for datatypes.
**		It also sought to compile on a large number of platforms,
**		while requiring precise control over memory layout.  Even as
**		years passed and other advancements were made in C and C++,
**		nothing happened on this front:
**      	
**			"One of the biggest flaws in the C language was not
**			 to indicate bitranges of integers.  You cannot
**			 'abstractly remove' the range of a number.  It is a
**			 critical part of its definition."
**				-- Carl Sassenrath
**				(comment from reb-c.h, in the 12-Dec-2012 open-sourcing)
**
**		It took a long long time (pun intended) but C99 eventually came
**		along with <stdint.h> to address the issue:
**
**			http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/types/integer
**
**			http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9834747/
**
**		So if <stdint.h> is available under a C99 compiler (or above),
**		the definitions are used.  Yet Rebol seeks to continue to build
**		and run on numerous legacy systems, in addition to modern ones.
**		Hence it has fallbacks to make the definitions it needs if 
**		there are no standard definitions.

**  ADDRESS AND FUNCTION POINTERS

**		Note that you *CANNOT* cast something like a `void *` to

**		guaranteed to be the same size as a data pointer, in either C
**		or C++.
**
**		To give an example of how much freedom the compiler has: it

**		and make a function "pointer" just a byte...that it looks up in
**		a table to dispatch!
**
**			http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3941793/
**
**		So if you want something to hold either a function pointer or
**		a data pointer, you have to implement that as a union...and
**		know what you're doing when writing and reading it.
**
**		!!! That explains why there is a need for a CFUNC type of some
**		kind as the "analogue of void* for data".  It doesn't explain
**		what FUNCPTR is for or why it is here, but it apparently
**		relates to something about how Rebol implemented ROUTINE!.

**  "REBOL CODE TYPES"
**
**		After doing all the work on defining a standard interface
**		for types and sizes, it might seem a bit weird to create
**		*another* level of indirection macros for naming them again...
**
**		@HostileFork reasons there are three likely motivations:
**
**		The first motivation is that Rebol C code and APIs have a lot
**		of types in all caps, with lowercase variable and parameter
**		names.  The interface looks more consistent when it's all
**		caps, and lowercase types break the rhythm.
**
**		There's also the chance to give semantic meaning to the same
**		type if its used in different ways.  So a REBCNT can convey
**		specifically the notion that it is used as a count (in the
**		spirit of something like C's `size_t`), which simply using
**		a `u32` might not convey.
**
**		Finally: putting REB in front of the name creates a kind of
**		namespacing for APIs that do not include reb-c.h (such as
**		hostkit, in theory).  Other C programs might have a different
**		definition for BOOL in terms of behavior and bit size.  The
**		REB names are unlikely to overlap.

**
**  DEFINITIONS FOR `char` vs. `REBYTE`
**
**		One thing in C that was always known and set in stone is that
**		`sizeof(signed char) == 1` and `sizeof(unsigned char) == 1`.
**		Yet even with this seeming anchor there is a catch: there's
**		no guarantee on whether a plain `char` is signed or unsigned.
**		It has to do with performance on certain architectures:
**
**			http://stackoverflow.com/questions/914242/
**
**		So in the Rebol codebase, REBYTE was standardized to be an
**		unsigned char, and used instead of the "less-reliable" `char`.
**		It also tried to redefine macros as wrappers over functions
**		like strlen() and strchr()...with the likes of:
**
**			#define COPY_BYTES(t,f,l) strncpy((char*)t, (char*)f, l)
**			#define LEN_BYTES(s) strlen((char*)s)
**
**		Besides the obvious burden of having to come up with names
**		and wrappers for everything in <string.h>, there were other
**		problems.  Since most compilers circa 2015 interpret char as
**		signed by default, if you turned on signedness-checking in C
**		(or used C++ where it's always on), you'd not be able to write:
**
**			const REBYTE *data = "some text"; 
**
**		Given char's pervasiveness, having Rebol-based APIs pass memory
**		buffers around using REBYTE* became a burden as well.  Ren/C++
**		suffered heavily on this point.
**
**		Yet there are *some* benefits to using an unsigned type, and
**		no decision has been reached on what the ultimate fate will
**		be.  The UTF-8 code in particular depends on it, so a simple
**		search-and-replace will not work.  Hence for now, a REBYTE* is
**		still what's used and passed around in Rebol most of the time.
**		(Unless it's a format string intended to be passed to a debug
**		routine, or similar.)
**
**		This is a simple compromise devised by @HostileFork for easily
**		switching between char pointers and REBYTE pointers when you
**		need to.  If you have bytes and need chars, use AS_CHARS if
**		you're working with mutable data and AS_CCHARS if its const.
**		Then if you have chars and need bytes use AS_BYTES/AS_CBYTES.

**  UNICODE CHARACTER TYPE

**  VARIANT CHARACTER TYPE BASED ON OPERATING SYSTEM
**
**		This file mentioned its purpose to be the nailing down of sizes
**		of a type, which was not done in C.  This makes the concept
**		of defining a type which varies greatly to seem like a bad
**		idea.  (And @HostileFork thinks it probably is...)
**
**		REBCHR is the idea of the size of a character that the OS uses.
**		Currently the supported platforms either use wide characters
**		(e.g. Windows with `typedef wchar_t WCHAR`) or just use ordinary
**		`char` like Linux and OS/X do for UTF-8.
**
**		Windows actually does `typedef wchar_t WCHAR` and then its binary
**		APIs depend on this size.  Hence any compiler for Windows must
**		have a 2-byte definition for wchar_t, or your programs won't work.
**		This means Windows programmers can confidently use routines like
**		wcslen() on strings they are passed from the OS.
**
**		Linux and OS/X haven't gone this direction.  Their APIs still use
**		plain chars, often passing-the-buck on who-and-where-and-how the
**		bytes will be encoded or decoded.  There aren't guarantees about
**		the wchar_t size.  It's often 4 bytes on 64-bit platforms:
**
** 			http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3877052/
**
**		This might make you wonder what the value of REBCHR is, and why
**		one wouldn't quarantine platform-specificity out of the Rebol
**		core.  Then require the hostkit to do all the translation so the
**		main of Rebol never knew about the details.  You might also
**		wonder about the use of such a prominent CHR name for something
**		that is quite so slippery...
**		
**		The answer seems to be that mostly REBCHR is indeed in the hostkit
**		as a way of letting the code look kind of similar, based on whether
**		you are reading the Windows code or the POSIX code.  It becomes
**		a little easier to copy between them or hold them side-by-side.
**		Yet largely it looks like a mistake that needs to be excised.
**
**		In the meantime, the macros are renamed to be more conspicuous
**		(e.g. LEN_OS_STR instead of LEN_STR to draw attention and avoid
**		errant usage).  If not using a wide char, then REBCHR is defined
**		as a char instead of a REBYTE.  This further assists in vetting
**		possible accidents with usage in core code processing REBYTE*.
